### Business Problem
The company is experiencing inconsistent sales performance across stores and is uncertain whether warranty programs are driving profitability or increasing long-term costs.

Management needs data-driven insights to answer:
* Which products and categories generate the highest revenue?
* Which stores are underperforming or outperforming?
* Are warranty sales contributing positively to profit?
* Is there a relationship between product sales volume and warranty claims?
* Which products have high warranty claim rates that may signal quality issues?

### Objective
The objective is to evaluate store performance, identify top-performing products, and assess the profitability and risk of warranty programs. Through SQL-based KPI calculations and interactive Tableau dashboards, this case study demonstrates how data-driven insights can improve revenue optimization, operational efficiency, and strategic decision-making in the retail industry.

The primary objective of this analysis is to:
> Optimize sales performance and improve profitability by identifying high-performing products, store performance gaps, and warranty-related risks.

This project aims to:
* Evaluate revenue trends by product, category, and store
* Measure warranty attachment rate (warranty sales vs product sales)
* Analyze warranty claim frequency and potential cost impact
* Identify low-performing stores and high-risk products
* Provide actionable recommendations for revenue growth and cost reduction
